<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Subiksha Selvarajah, a passionate and enthusiastic web developer. I love creating clean,
   user-friendly, and responsive websites that not only look good but also function smoothly. 
   My journey in web development started with a deep curiosity about how websites work behind the scenes, 
   and that curiosity quickly turned into a strong passion.</p>

<p>I enjoy working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React to bring creative ideas to life.
   Whether it's designing the layout or coding the logic, I find joy in every step of the development process. 
   I’m always eager to learn new tools and techniques to improve my skills and stay updated with the latest trends 
   in the tech world.</p>

<p>As a dedicated learner and problem-solver, I aim to build websites that make a difference—helping people,
   businesses, and communities. My dream is to grow as a full-stack developer and contribute to meaningful projects.
    I believe that with passion, consistency, and continuous learning, anything is possible..</p>
